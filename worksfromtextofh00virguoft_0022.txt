xx BIOGBAPIIICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL.

the general expectation of such a Person then prevalent in the East.¹ It is also
remarkable that AElian mentions the J nwtsn SIBYL, together with the Cumaean ;2
her oracles, therefore, which were probably in substance the same as the· pro-
phetical writings, were likely to bc in the collection. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
on the authority of Varro, asserts that such of the prophecies as were not genuine
were written in acrosticlis.³ Eusebius has preserved a pretended acrostich oracle
of the Erythraean Sibyl, the initial letters of which form the words ΙΗΣΟΥΣ
ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΥΙΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ ΣΤΑΥΡΟΣ; but this is evidentlya for-
gery on the bare inspection. We have σοὶρξ used for mankind, εἴδωλα for idols,
and in one place the very words of Scripture have been quoted: “ Θρῆνός τ’ ἐκ
πάντων ἔσται καὶ βρύγμος. ebdom-ff Constantine, in his “ Λόγος ’τῷ τῶν
ἁγίων συλλόγῳ,” gives a very elaborate interpretation of the Pollio, with a
Greek translation of the greater part of it‚and asserts that the bracle, whence it
was taken, was translated by Cicero into Latin verse, and annexed to his poems.
We have now no traee of this translation, if it ever existed ς but it is a curicus
circumstance, that Cicero informs us that the Sibylline oracles did predict a king,
and were written in acrostichs.⁴ If any name were mentioned in them, it must
have been Cornelius 3 as the pretence which Lentulus adduced for his connection
with Catiline was a Sibylline prophecy, portending that the empire of Rome was
to be given to three Cornelii ‚⁵⁷ Cinna and Sylla having been the two former, the
third was to be himself. Itis by no means improbable that, among the pro-
phecies copied from the Jewish Scriptures, or gleaned from Jewish tradition,
which were in all probability found among the Sibylline writings, the great Sub-
Jcct of prediction was called 53 tva the power of Θόᾶ,ὓ which would assuredly
have been translated Cornelius by' the Romans.

The author of the ingenious and elaborate Observations, who conceives that
virgil meant to refer the Sibyl's prediction to Augustus, imagines the whole
poem to be a metrical horoscope, and discovers a clear explanation of every
expression and allusion contained in it, by a reference to the phraseology of
astrologieal art. How far this author is bigoted to hypothesis, may be conjec-
tnred from his application of the following lines to the sign Aries: δ

Ipse sed in pratis Aries jam suave rubenti
Murice, jam croceo mutabit vellera luto.
