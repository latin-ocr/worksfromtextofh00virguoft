Poenus VIRGILIUS¹ MARo was born at Andes, near Mantua, on the 15th
October, uc. 684. His father, Virgilius Maro, was an opulent farmer3 who,
being an intelligent person, gave his son a liberal Greek and Latin education at
Cremona and Milan, which was completed under the poet Parthenius, aud the
Epicurean Syrou. From his father, virgil inherited the family estate at Mantua.
But before the Triumvirate undertook their expedition against Brutus and Cas-
sius, they had agreed at Mutina, in order to retain their soldiers in allegiance,
to give them, in the event of success, eighteen prineipal towns of Italy, which
had adbel-ed to the opposite faction; and among these were Venusiutn and Cre-
mona. Thus, in the distribution which followed the consummation of the war,
the neighbourhood of Mantua to the devoted Cremona ensured it a fate scarcer
less deplorable from the lawless soldiery. The patrimony of virgil was conse-
quently confiscated. By whose intercession he regained it authors are not
agreed. Asinius Pollio and MaeeenaS‚ the celebrated patron of literature, have
the best authorities in their favour. Pollio, having charge of that district, pro-
bably recommendet} his case to Maecenas, who was little likely to have been
otherwise acquainted with the son of obscure rustics, as all Virgil's biographers
represent his parents to have been. On this event his Ist Eclogue was, most

¹ Verqz‘lius in the oldest Medicean MSS„ and in the Vatican M S.
