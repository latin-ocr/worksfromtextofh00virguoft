BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. XXiX

same to whom the Culex is addmssed, he cannot be the Octavius of whose
opinion Horace speaks so highly in the Xth Satire of his Ist Book, since the
Catalecta were, according to Donatus’s account, completed when virgil was
fifteen years of age.¹ From the dedication, the poet proceeds to a. most glowing
description of sunrise, and a goatherd driving his flock afield: and thence takes
occasion to indulge in a long digression on the happiness of rural life, which,
though less polished, is more winning and pathetic than the corresponding
passage in the Georgics. He has not, indeed, surpassed in intensity of relish for
the country his great model Lucretius3 but he has amplified him with great
taste and independence, and this passage, taken all in all, is one of the most
vivid and delicious in the whole range of Latin Poetry. From this, Virgil
returns to his short narrative. The noon approaches‚ and his rustic hero seeks
the shelter of a grove to enjoy his siesta. While he is sleeping, a serpent is on
the point of destroying him, when a gnat, perceiving his danger, gives notice to
him by a timely sting. Enragedwith the insect, of whose benevolent intention he
is ignorant, he instantly crushes him. At night, however, the shade of the guat
appears to him, and, after a poetical but tedious description of the regions of the
departed, reproaches him for his ingratitude. In this passage the reader may
trace the sketches from which Virgil afterwards drew his finished pictures of the
appearance of Hector, and the descents of Orpheus and AEneas. The goatherd,
on awaking, as the only compensation in his power, erects a monument to his
benefactor, with an inscription, which concludes the poem :

Parve Culex, pecudum custos tibi tale merenti
Funeris officium vitae pro munere reddit.

The character of Virgil, as drawn by Asconius Pedianus, and preserved to us
by Donatus, is eminently pleasing. He is there represented as kind in disposition,
attached to the learned and the virtuous, free from all envy, and delighted with
the literary success of others no less than with his own 3 blaming none, and praisin g
the good3 and so affable in manner, that none but the most perverse could fail
to like, and even love him. He seemed to consider nothing his own, his library
belonged as much to his literary friends as to himself3 and he often quoted the
adage in Euripides, τοὶ τῶν φίλων κοινά. By this amiable and conciliatory life,
110 established himself 111 the esteem of all the most eminent of his literary con-
temporaries; especially in that of Horace, Propertius, Varius, Tucca, and Pollio.
From Donatus, however, we learn that Anser declined his acquaintance from
party considerations, being himseif attached to Antony, in whose praise he com-
posed a poem. Yet the splendour of Virgil's success attracted many to perish in
the blaze which they sought to extinguish. On the appearance of his Bucolics,
an anonymous author published a dull parody, called A7ztz'bucolz‘cc25 and oue
