BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. XXVfi

According to Donatus he composed his epitaph, to be inscribed on his tomb at
Naples‚ whither 116 desired his body to be conveyed for burial :

Mantua me genuit; Calabri rapuere ς tenet nunc
Parthenope3 cecini pascua, rura, duces.

The intemal evidence militares forcibly against the ascription of these verses.
virgil was, however, buried (by order of Augustus, Donatus says‚) iu the road
from Naples to Pulteoli, within two miles of the former place. On his death-bed
he earnestly desired that his ΑαἘηείτῖ, as an imperfect work, might be burned,
and even left in his will an injunction to that effect. Being, however, infornied
by the celebrated Varius and Plotius Tucca, (the same who is mentioned by
Horace, in his journey to Brundusium) that Augustus would not permit the
destruction of his poem, he left it to them to publish‚ on condition that they
would make no additions to the text, even for the purpose of supplying an
unfinished verse. How far his executors were faithful to their trust must now
be uncertain; several unfinished verses are extant in the AEneid ; but the
terminations of some complete lines render it not improbable that they have
been supplied by another pen. The biography and the writings of virgil have,
unfortunately, fallen into the hands of ignorant grammarians and monastice, who
have most miserably corrupted both. A sample of the absurd legends with which
some of his biographers have disfigured his history shall be presently offered to
the ourious reader. The corruptions of his writings are chiefly to be found 111
his minor poems. Donatus, presenting us with some occasional verses, which
internal aud external evidences alike repudiate,l mentions, as his acknowledged
works, the Catalecto, the Illoretum, the Priapeia, the Ερῐῃναῃῑε, the Dirce,
and the Culez; and notices a poem called AEtna, the genuineness of which he
considers doubtful. This poem is to be found, illustrated with copious disserta-
tions, and notices of the authors to whom it has been ascribed, 111 the fourth
volume of Wernsdorf’s Poe‘tce Minores, where it is attributed to Lucilius J unior,
a writer of the time of Nero. To these, Servius adds the (lirina, which is the
same with the Ciris (a poem with some plausibility ascribed to Catullus,) and
the Copa. The catalecta are miscellaneous little poems, mostly in the style of

l We may possibly except the epitaph on Balista, Virgirs schoolmaster. who was stoned for his
robberies:

Monte sub hoc lapidum tegitur Balista sepultus;
Nocte, die, tutum, carpe, viator, iter.

The verses are not first-rate3 but the author is represented as “puer adhuc ; '' and the occasion
was provocative of the feelings of a schoolboy. In Donatus's description of Balista⁷ “Ludi gla-
diatorii magistrum‚” the word “gladiatorii '¹ is not in the earliest editions. Phocas is the authority
sor making Bausta schoolmaster to Virgil. De vit. virg. 41 seqq.
