BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. XXXi

He erected statues representing various nations3 and, when any nation was about
to revolt against the Empelor, the conesponding statue rang a small bell, and
gave warning to arm for the contest.· As he advanced in ysea1, he became
desimus of renovating his youth by enchantment3 and, with this view, erected a
castle' m a lonely spot, in the porch of which hes set twenty· -four copper statues,
armed with iron flails, twelve on each side, which threshed continually, except
when he withheld them. Hither he conducted a servant3 and, leading him into
a room lighted by a perpetual lamp, bade him kill him, cut the body in picceS‚
and place it in a barrel‚ for the oil of the lamp to drop upon for nine days, after
which Virgil was to come forth a youth. The lamp was, notwithstanding, to
be replenished daily. The instructions were complied with. The servant was
made acquainted with the method of stopping the flails, and visited the apart-
ment every day to replenish the lamp. At length the Emperor, missing virgil
from court, threatened the servant with death if he did not convey him to his
master. When the domestic had led the Emperor to the enchanted room, and
had confessed his deed, the prince slew him on the spot. The figure of a little
g child was forthwith seen running round the barrel, exclaiming, ‘⁶ Cursed be the

,ἶ time that ye ever came here.'' The replenishing of the lamp being suspended,

“ μ. the. renovation was incomplete, and the magician poet died.

Such is a specimen of the extraordinary absurdities wherewith mediaeval
writers have overlaid the biography of Virgil. It is, however, but a very slight
notice of the mythology connected with the subject. Many fabulous inventions
are omitted, and those which have been adduced have been merely sketched, as
some readers may deem even these slender particulars unworthy of allusion in a
serious though compendious biography. They have, however, in the writer’s
opinion, their value--they show the high reputation which the name of Virgil
had attained, even when his works were least appreciated3 for magical powers
were then ascribed in proportion as intellectual were exhibited3 and though
Virgil's mathematica] and physica] studies may have had possibly some influence
in originating the fables reported of him, yet the general celebrity of his writings,
the judgment of ancient crines, and the estimate which the learned were still
able to form of his works, are sufficient to account for the phenomenon. These
tales, in truth, only speak the language of one to whom they perhaps were, and
their subject certainly was, amply familiar:

“ Glon‘e and honour, Virgile Mantuan,
Be to thy name! ”¹
