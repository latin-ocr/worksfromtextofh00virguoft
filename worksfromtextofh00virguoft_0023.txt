and there can be no doubt that the same ingenuity, had this line followed those
above cited, would have given an equally convincing interpretation of Tauris.
Any mind unsophisticated by hypothesis cannot fail to perceive that the poet is
describing a time of universal opulence and rest, when agriculture and commerce
should be alike unnecessary: and when the ram in the meadows (not in the
skies), should wear his fleece, without the dyer's labour, attired in the most
costly and splendid colours.¹
That the Daphnis was composed, like Milton’s Lycidas, to commemorate
the death of some real person, is scarcely to be doubted. That Menalcas repre-
’ sents Virgil is evident from the conclusion, wherein he states himself to be the
author of two of Virgil's Ecloguesſj¹ Mopsus, according to Servius, is AEmilius
Macer of Verona, who wrote a poetical history of serpents, plants, and birds, in
imitation of Nicander, and a supplement to the Iliad, called Antehomerz'ca and
Posthomerz'ca. Bernhardy, Bahr, and others, after Wernsdorf, attribute, how-
ever, the epic and didactic poems to different writers of the same name.² If
Daphnis be a personification, Julius Caesar is the only person whom the character
can pourtray, as Heyne justly observes: although be believes the poem to be
merely a commemoration of the celebrated Sicilian shepherd. Servius and

Donatus make Daphnis the poet's brother Flaccus. An uncertain epigrammatist
has the following distich :

Tristia fata tui dum fles in ‘⁴ Daphnide⁷' Flacci,
Docte Maro, fratrem Dis immortalibus aequas.

Virgil concludcd his Bucolics with an elegant cempliment to Cornelius Gallus,
a celebrated contemporary poet, born at Forum Julii, in Gaul, about Virgil's
own age, and his fellow-pupil under Syron, consoling him for the loss of his
Lycoris, whom the old commentator-s assert to have been an actress, whose real
name was Cytheris. She was the freedwoman of Volumnius Eutrapelus, and took
the name of Volumnia. As she was familiar with Antony, the old commentatore,
have supposed that she deserted Gallus to accompany Antony on his Gallic
expedition. Heyne, however, in his argument of the Gallus, has shown, from
chronological considerations, that this could not be the case. The genuine poems
of Gallus, with the exception of a few fragments, are lost. They consisted of
four books of elegieS‚ called Amores or Lycoris, and a translation of Euphorion,
as we learn from Servius. A pretended edition of the works of Gallus was pub-
lished by Pomponio Gaurico, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, but the
fraud was soon detected in Italy, and Tiraboschi attributes these poems‚³ accord-
