BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. ΧΧ111

The fact was, that a more effectual and more delicate expedient for calling the
attention of Augustus to this important subJect could not be imagined3 and in
his power lay a great portion of the remedy.

Of the character of the Georgics it is unnecessary to speak‚ because no
reader of this memoir can be ignorant that this poem is the most elaborate and
extraordinary instance of the power of genius in embellishing a. most barren
subject, which human wit has ever afforded. The commonest precepts of
farming are delivered with an elegance which could scarcely be attained by a
poet who should endeavour to clothe in verse the sublimest maxims of philo-
sophy. Indeed, one consideration alone is sufficient to show us the excellence
of Virgil in this particular-the uniform failnre of his imitators. Itis, however,
much to be regretted that he was not free to choose his own subject, as, in all
probability, 116 would have selected a theme better suited to his Muse. It is
said that the poet, while employed on this immortal work, composed many
verses every morning3 but, by the evening, reduced them to a very few3 so
that he used to compare himself to a bear, which licks her shapeless offspring
into form.¹

According to the computatiou of Donatus, or the writer of the Lffe of Vir-qil
ascribed to him, the poet must have been at Naples, after six years’ attention
to the Georgics‚ when Augustus undertook the expedition against Antony‚
which ended 111 the decisive victory of Actium. To the year following that
engagement the completion of the Georgics is commonly assigned. At what
time the Ainez'cl was first projected, is uncertain, but Virgil, like our Milton,
appears from a very early period to have had a strong desire of composing an
epic poem, and, like him also, to have been long undecided on his subject.
That he had attempted something of the kind, before the Eclogues were finished,
is evident from these verses in his Silenus .-

Quiim canerem reyes et proelia, Cynthius aurem
Velh't, et admonuit,—

and his ambition to produce some work of distinguished excellence is attested
by the ardent exclamation in the opening of the IIId Georgic ε

Tentanda via est, qufi. me quoque possim
Tollere humo, victorque virfim volitare per ora.

Even in his Culex, which he is said to have written at fifteen years of age, he
gives promise of higher things :

Posterihs graviore sono tibi Musa loquetur
Nostra, dabunt quiin] securos mihi tempora fructus
Ut tibi digna tuo poliantur carmina sensu.

1 Donat. in Vit. Virg. ix.; Quinct. Lib. x. 3; Aul. Gen. xviL 10.
