Catullus. One Epigram, intituled Votum pro suscepta AEne'z'clc, will not be
ungi-utcsul to the rcader :

Si mihi susceptum suerit decurrere munus,

Ο Paphon, ὃ sedes quae colis Idaliasl
Trqus AEneas Romana per oppida digno

J 3111 tandem ut tecum carmine vectus eat:
Non ego thure modo, 3111 picta tua templa tabella

Ornabo, et puris serta seram manibus:
Corniger hos aries humiles 61 maxima taurus

Victima sacratos tinget honore foeos3
Marmoreusque tibi, Dea, versicoloribus alis,

In morem picta stabit Amor pharetra.
Adsis, ὀ Cytherea! tuus te Caesar Olympo,

Et Surrentini litoris ora vocant.

It is scarcely necessary to distinguish the Catalecta from the Epigrammata.
The nature of the Priapeia it is obviously unnecessary to investigate. The
work now extant under that title 13, substantially, Augustan, but the character ⁴
of virgil forbids us to suppose that 1113 pen has contributed to it in any im·-
portant degree. The Dirce is a poem attributed more correctly to Valerius
Cato. The Illoretum is a piece of very peculiar beauty 3 and approaches nearer
10 Theocritus in spirit 111311 any of the Bucolics. It bears also a remarkable
resemblance to Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy. It is a lively description of a rustic's
day, and takes its name from a kind of salad, called IlIoretum, the making of
which is described in it. The Copa is a Bacchanalian invitation, in the person
of a δορα, 01 Syrian woman, who attended, as a (lancer or singer, on houses of
public entertainment—“ Ambubaiarum colleyia.’⁷

Of all the minor poems, however, ascribed to Virgil, the Culex is, for many
16330113, 1116 11631 deserving notice. Whatever doubts may be thrown on the
genuineness of the others, there seems to be every reason for believing that this
poem, allowing for a¹ll its gross and manifold corruptions, is the work of Virgil.
That Virgil wrote a poem bearing this name cannot be questioned3 for, besides
the testimony of Donatus and Servius, we have the more respectable evidences
of 11311131,ι 81311113,2 31111 Lucan,3 for the fact. Donatus quotes two verses from
the poem, and Nonius Marcellus one, which are found in the extant copies.
The poem, however, seems to have suffered much from alterations and inter-
poltations. Allowing sor these, it must have been a very beautiful productim,
and by far the most original effort of Virgil’s Muse. It opens with a dedication
to Octavius3 who this Octavius was is a matter of uncertainty. In the Cata-
lecta mention is made of 3 certain Octavius who died in a paroxysm of anger
occasioned by drinking, if this person be, as some commentatore suppose, the
