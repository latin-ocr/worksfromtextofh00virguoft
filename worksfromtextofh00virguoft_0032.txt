XXX BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGII..

Carvilius Pictor, in imitation of his worthy prototypo Zoilus, composed an
*Eneidomastir Bavius and Mawius, proverbial names for the impersonation
of united dulness, cnvy, and calumny, attaekcd Virgil, and Cornificius, also,
appears to hare written against him. virgil is said to have retaliated under
the name of Amyntas, in his Alexis and Daphnis.¹ But the most triumphant
refutation of his adversaries has been the judgment of posterity. No writer,
probably, ever exercised so wide an iussuenee either in time or space. His works
became fortliwitli,² and still remain, text-books and school—books; they were even
translated into Greek, they were commented on by a cloud of grammarians;
they were thc subject of innumerablc epigrams3 they were formed into centos3
they were used for the purposes of divination. Virgil was the model of the
Carlovingian poets; thc “Magnus Apollo’' of the chivalrous Von Veldeck3
Dante exulted in his guidance, and the later poetry of all Europeans has done
homage to his supreinacy.

In person, according to Donatus, virgil was tal13 his complexion was dark,
his expression rustic, his manners shy, and of almost feminine modesty. These
particular-s may very well be traditional. Allusion has been already made to the
magical powers ascribed to him, and, as a matter of curiosity, and illustr-ative
of the ideas which prevailed concerning him 111 1110 middle ages, some of these
sables may he appended. None of them are probably older than the llth cen-
tury. According, then, to his mediaeval chroniclcrs, Virgil became acquainted with
necromancy by the assistance of an evil spirit, who promised to instruct him in
the art so that he should never be surpasscd, on condition of being liberated from
a cavern in the side of a hill in which he was confined. Virgil fulfilled the con-
dition, and afterwards defied the spirit to enter the hole at which he came out.
The challenge was accepted3 but no sooner was the demon in the cave than
virgil closed it upon him. The story is probably derived from an Arabian tra-
dition. Virgil's first necromantic exploit was the erection of the city of Naples,
which he built on a foundation of eggS. On a square tower which he constructed
there, 110 50 balanced an egg, that, when it stirred, the city would be shaken with
an earthquake3 and, whencver it broke, the city would sink. He made, and placed
on one of the gates of his favourite town, a fly of copper, which prevented all
living flies from entering the city. On a mount near that place, he set up a
statue of thc same metal, with a trumpet in its mouth, which, when the north
wind blew, drove the fire and smoke from “the forges of Vulcan '⁷ with great noise
to the sea. IIe made 0 public fire, near which 110 01001οᾶ 0 brazen archer with
bended bOW, beneath which was inscribed: ‘⁴ Whoever strikes me, I shoot my ⁴
arrOW.'’ A maniae defied the warning, when the statue discharged his arrow
into the tire, and extinguished it. He surrounded his house and garden with an
mmovable atmosphere, so that it never rained within the charmed enclosure.
