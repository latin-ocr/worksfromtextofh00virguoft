imperial Rome was ill suited to coni-ey the unpremeditated effusions of unlettered
herdsmen. If virgil, therefore, has fallen very sar short of his great prototype,
the difficulty of his attempt must not be sorgotten. Indccd, he appears not in-
sensible os it himselt'; and, by the nature os the lang-uage 111 which he composed,
he has been compelled to abandon his original intention, and to attempt loftier
ssights than the nature os pastoral poetry strictly justifies.

The Eclogues of virgil possess one remarkable characteristic, they are alle-
gories. This at once introduces a great differ-enee between them and the Theo-
critean ldyl. The allegorical veil is sometimes allowed to fall, and the shepherds
who represent the poet and his friends converse like scholare and philosophers.
It has been a great question, whether the Alexis partakes of this figurative
character3 many are of opinion that it is merely an imitation of the Ἐραστὴς
of Theocritus. All the grammarians, however, identify the poet with Corydon,
and there is the higher authority of his contemporary, Propertius, as well as
those ot'Martial and Apulejus, on the same side ς1 11111 1110 real name of Alexis is
a 1113110101 considerable doubt. The opinion mentioned by Servius, that Augustus
was intended, scarcely deserves to be noticed. Some make Alexis to have becn
Alexander, a slave os Pollio ; but most probably he belonged to Maecenas.
Paint'ul doubts overhang this portion of Virgil's history 3² but Juvenal most as-
suredly did not make any allusion to the subject in the following lines, which
Dryden has most grossly amplified and perverted :³—
si Virgilio puer et tolerabile deesset

Hospitium, caderent omnes 0 crinibus hydri,—
Surda nihil gemeret grave buccina.

 

There is difficulty in believing this to have been the first of Virgil's compositione,
on the supposition of Alexis being the slave either of Maecenas or Augustus3
inasmuch as, in that case, it must have been written before we have* any account
of Virgil’s acquaintance with either.

But the most extraordinary composition of virgil is his Pollio, a poem which

suos 1meros.'‘—Vit. Viry. 20. Charity “hopeth all things;'' but the state of heathen morality,
even among the most intellectual and refined, was such as to allow and indulge abominatione
which, in any professedly Christian society, however rude, would cover their perpetrator-s with
nfamy: and whatever may have been the conductos Virgil, Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, and others,
they have not hesitated to follow Greek examples of this nature in their writz'nys. It 15, however
right to obser-ve that the Roman poets generally claimed the privileqe of bad morais on paper,
while they renounced it in act. See in particular Catull. xvii.; Ovid. T1ist. ii. 1543 Mart. i. 15
Plin. Epist. tii. ,ῦς iv. 14; and Hadrian's epitaph on Voconius. Profligate literature was no dis·
grace, rather otherwise, even when a profligate lit'e would have been inlamous. The peculiarity
of Virgil's case, however, is, that he makes no such apology for himself, and, indeed, needs it less,
perhaps, than any of liis extant contemporaries, while yet his identity with his “Corydon'’
appears, from exter-nal evidence, to be indubitable. On this account his memory bears a stain,
which those of Horace and Tibullus, who have mitten as offensively, have commonly escaped.
