ing to common repert, to a certain Maximinian, who flourished in the time of
Boetius. As an elegiae poet, Gallus ranked very high in public opinion. Ovid
speaks of his fame as univers2d3 Propertius and Martia] have home testimony
to his exeellence; and Virgil, in his beautiful and extraordinary VIth Eclogue,
has panegyrized his Euphorion in the noblest strains of niythological eulogy.
Virgil had also, according to Servius, celebrated his praises in the conclusion of
his Georgica Gallus was no less distinguished as a warrior than as a poet, he
was of great service to Augustus in the Egyptian war, and assisted in securing
the person of Cleopatra. Ile was, in consequence, constituted the first prefect
of Egypt. Here he appears to have conducted himself with arrogance and in-
solence. He was afterwards condemned to banishment by the command of
Augustus, on suspicion of having conspired against him, a sentence which, how-
ever, the poet anticipated by a voluntary death, υς). 728ς and Virgil, at the
instance of the emperor, substituted sor his eulogy on Gallus the fable of Aris-
toens.

The publication of Virgil's Bucolics created a powerful sensation in literary
Rome. The grammarians tell us that they were recited on the stage3¹ and
that, on one occasion, when Cicero was present in the theatre‚ and heard some

verses of the Silenus recited by Cytheris, he called for the whole eclogue‚ and,
when he had heard it through, exclaimed, “Maynae spes altera Romae.”

This cannot be true, for Cicero was then dead: but we have better authority
for the truth of the honours publicly lavished on Vir-gil. From the author of the
Dialogue (lc 01·at0rz'bus² we learn that, when some verses of Virgil were recited
on the stage, and the poet happened to be present, all the spectatore rose, and
paid him the same marks of respect which they would have shown to Augustae.
Propertius³ has celebrated the conclusion and publication of the Bucolics, and
Ovid’ has soretold their immortality.

The poetical power which the Bucolics discovered induced Maecenas, almost
as soon as they were finished (about uc. 717), to request Virgil to undertake
the Georgics. The neglected state of agriculture, in consequence of the civil
wars, might be the reason why Maecenas chose this subject for Virgil's Muse:
and indeed this condition of the country is graphically described by the poet
himself: ⁵

Ubi fas versa atque nefas3 tot bella per orbem,
Tam multae scelerum facies: non ullus aratro

Dignus honos: squalent abductis arva colonis,
Et curvae m'gidum falces conflantur in ensem.

But we must not suppose the statesman to have conceived that the military
settlers could be moved by an exquisite poem to the cultivation of their estates.
