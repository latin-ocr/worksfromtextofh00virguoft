XXVi BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL.

The style, for sweetness and for beauty, occasionally, and in the author'a
finished passages, surpasses almost every other production of antiquity. “ I see
no foundation,⁷’ says Dr. Blair, “for the opinion entertained by some critics
that the AEneicl is to be considered as an allegorical poem, which carries a con-
stant reference to the character and reign of Augustus Caesar ς οι· that Virgil's
main design in composing the AEnez'd was to reconcile the Romans to the
government of that prinee, who is supposed to be shadowed out under the
character of AEncas ..... He had sufficient motives‚ as a poet, to determine
him to the choiee of his subject, from its being in itself both great and pleasing3
from its being suited to his genius, and its being attended with peculiar ad-
vantages for the full display of poetical talents.’' ¹

The first six books of the AEncid arethe most elaborate part of the poem.
The imperfections of the AEneid are alleged to be want of originality in some
of the principal scenes, and defectiveness in the exhibition of character. That
of Dido is by sar the most decided and complete. But Voltaire has justly
observed upon the strange confusion of interest excited by the story of the wars
in Italy, in which oue is continually tempted to espouse the cause of Turnus
rather than that of AEnea53 and to which the exquisite soenes for displaying
the tenderness of the poet iu narrating the story of Lavinia, seem to have been
his only temptation.]

Virgil‚ having just revised and altered the Bucolics and Georgios, projected,
with a view to giving the ultimate polish to the AEneid, which he had now eom-
pleted, a tour in Greeee and Asia. With a dread almost prophetie, and an
ardour not disproportionate, Horace addressed the ship which bore his departing
friend :-— ‘

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,

Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,

Obstrictis aliis, praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditum

Debes Virgssium, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem, precor,

Et serves animae dimidium meae ! ²

At Athens the poet met with Augustus, who was returning from Samos, where
he had wintered after his Syrian expedition, to Rome. Changing his former
intention, virgil determined to accompany his patron. On a visit to Megara
he was seized with a sudden indisposition, which his voyage increased, and he
died a few days aster his arrival at Brundusium,3 in his fifty-second year.

³ In a life of virgil, prefixed to the Venetian edition of 1472, attributed to Servius, it is said
that he dled at Tarentum, on his way to Metapontum.
