BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL. ς XXV

persons of education. Most scholare are agreed that it wants the natural
freshness and frecdom of Homer, while it exhibits a degree of art, elegance‚ and
majesty never attempted in any poem, save the Georgics of its author. It may,
however, be pertinent to remark, that, smooth and uniform as its surface seems,
it is really, in great measure, mosaic. That Vir-gil should have translated whole
passages out of Homer, or even the Alexandr-ine writers, is no matter of cen-
sure: he and his contemporaries would have thought the absence of such
“ purpurei panni '' a defect3 and the high authorities of Dante, Ariosto, Tasso,
Spenser, Camoens, and Milton ratify their opinion. But the same cannot be
said of plagiarisms from Latin authors. How unscrnpulously he appropriated ¹
whole verses of Ennius, of Lucretius, of Lucilius, of even his friend Varius, and
of others, the curious reader may find in the VIth Book of Macrobius’s Satur-
nalia, which will abundantly repay his perusal. His merit, therefore, in not
interfering when others plagiarized his verses, and gained credit by them, is
not so great as Donatus would have us believe. It may be right to add that
the AEneid is a most conspicuous evidence of the learning, diligence, and anti-
quarian research of its illustrious author.

[¹Availing himself of the pride and superstition of the Roman people, which
g‘never abounded more than during the Augustan age, the poet traces the origin
and establishment of the “ eternal city ’' to those heroes and actions which had.
enough in them of what was human and ordinary to excite the sympathy of his
countrymen3 intermingled with persons and circumstances of an extraordinary
and superhuman character, to awaken their admiration and their awe. No
subject could have been more happily chosen. It has been admired too for its

‘- perfect unity of action, for while the episodes command the richest variety of

² description, they are always subordinated to the main object of the poem, which
is to impress the divine authority under which AEneas first settled in Italy. The
wrath of J uno, upon which the whole fate of AEneas seems at first suspended, is
at once that of a woman and a goddess: the passion of Dido, and· her general
character, bring us nearer the present world ; but the poet is continually intro-
ducing higher and more effectual influenceS, until, by the intervention of the
father of gods and men, the Trojan name is to be continued in the Roman, and
thus heaven and earth are appeased.

Hinc genus, Ausonio mixtum quod sanguine surget,
Supra homines, supra ire Deos pietate videbis3
Nec gens ulla tuos aeque celebrabit honores.
Annuit his J uno, et mentem laetata retorsit.
