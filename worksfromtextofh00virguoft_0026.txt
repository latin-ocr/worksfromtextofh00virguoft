XXiV BIOGBAPIJICAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIL.

IIc is said to have begun a metrical chronicle of the Alban kings, but afterwards
to have desisted in consequence of the harshness of the names.¹ After the com-
pletion of thc Georgies, or, perhaps, some short time before, hc laid down the
plan of a regular epic on the wanderings of AEncas, and the Roman destinies 3
to form a sort of continuation of the Iliad to the Roman times, and to combine
the features of that poem and the Oclgsssey. The idea was sufficiently noble,
and the poem, long before its publication, or even conclusion, had obtained the
very highest reputation. While virgil was employed on the AEnez'd, “ quo nul-
lum Latio clarius caestat opus‚’' ² Propertius wrote with generous admiration :

Cedite, Romani scriptores! cedite, Graii!
Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade! ³

Angustus, while absent on his Cantabrian campaign, wrote repeatedly to Virgil
for extraets from his poem in progress3 but the poet declined, on the ground
that his work was unworthy the perusal of the prince· The correspondenc'e is
recorded by Macrobius, in the Ist Book of the Saturnalia ,· but its genuineness

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is very questionable. The poet, on a subsequent occasion, recited to Augustus
the IInd, IVth, and VIth Books of the AEnez'd: the noblest portions, perhaps,
of the whole poem. At the verse ending “ Tu Marcellus eris‚” Octavia, who
was present, is said to have fainted, overeome by this laudatory mention of her
deceased son, and to have presented Yirgil with 10 sesterces for every verse of
the passage.

It would be palpably superfluous, in a sketch of this nature, to attempt an
elaborate criticism on this great poem, familiar from their childhood to all
