BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF VTRGIL. XlX

has been the subjectos endless conjecture. The much litigated and unsettled
question, “ whom was it intended to commemorate‘?” we shall pass over, as
not materially connected with our subject 3 only observing that this honour has
been ascribed to the young Marcellus, to a son of Pollio, to a son of Augustus,
to Asinius Gallus, to Drusus, and lastly‚ even to Augustus himself-¹ What is
principally worthy of notice is, that this poem exhibits a coincidence with the
Sacred Writings too close to be fortuitons. That the Greeks had acquired in-
directly some acquaintance with the histon'es of the Hebrew Scriptures is not to
be doubted3 as Hesiod and ovid, the expounders of their theology‚ have clearly
discovered it, and it is probable that Theocritus, at the court of Ptolemy, had
seen the Sacred Volume, and even horrowed its phraseology.² But· iu this poem
virgil only imitated Theocritus in the structure of the composition, for, with one
or two exceptions, there is no similarity in details, which iu virgil resemble an
epitome of Scripture prophecies of the Messiah. Though much of the sabulous
history of the early world is corrupted from Holy Scripture, the Greeks in general
were ignorant of its source, aud were too much possessed with a contempt for
“ barbariau” literature to stndy, much less to imitate, the Hebrew writers. The
universal contempt entertained for the Jews at Rome made it still less probable
that their literature would meet imitation, or even perusal, there. An intelligent
writer,S indeed, imagines that he has discovered an avowal, on the part of Vir-
gil, of his intention to avail himself of the treasures of Hebrew poetry, in the
line*

Primus Idumaeas referam tibi, Mantua, palmas 3

but to this it is only necessary to reply, that the line cited was not mitten until
after the Pollio was composed. The inquiret must, therefore, advance on other
ground than that of supposing that Virgil accommodated the prophetie Scriptures
to his purpose· The poet has, indeed, given us a clue in our inquiries, he has
asserted that his prophecies are taken from the verses of the Cumaean Sibyl.
The fable of the Sibyl’s interview with Tarquin is well known. The books which
she was supposed to have given to the Romans were destroyed in the conflagra-
tion of the Capitol during the Mai-sian war3 emissaries were then despatched by
the Senate throughout Italy, Greece, Asia, and the coasts of Africa, to col-
lect the best anthenticated prophecies of the various Sibyls3 and the collection
thus made was called “ Cumaeum Carmen,” because it was compiled to supply
the loss of the writings of the Cumaean Sibyl. In this miscellany it is nothing im-
probable that prophecies of the great Person then about to appear should be found :
especially when it is recollected that Tacitus and Suetonius have borne witness to

The last opinion is maintained at great length, 11 a work entitled, “ Observations in mustra-
fiou of Virgil's celebrated Fourth Eclogue.” London, 1810.
