xvi BIOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR oF VIRGIL.

certainly, composed. The character of Tityrus in this poem may not have been
intended for Virgil himself, although some of the ancieuts so understood it, and
the poet elsewhere appropriates the name 3¹ it is, however, a lively picture of the
surprise and gratitude of an outcast, who finds himself suddenly restored to his
domestic comforts‚ and contrasts strikingly with the desperate melancholy of the
houseless wanderer Meliboeus, taking his last survey of the desolated hearth, with
which all his dearest affections were associated. The removal of Pollio was
attended with disastrous consequences to Virgil. His estate was again seized
by the rapacious military, and himself compelled to seek his safety by flight to
Rome. The story of his second expulsion is treated in the IXth Eclogue. He
succeeded in again recovering his patrimony, apparently through the interest of
one Varus, of whom he speaks in the highest strain of commendation in the
VIth and IXth Eclogues3 who this Varus was cannot now be determined.²
Perhaps he was Quinctilius Varus, whose death Horace deplores in the XXIVth
Ode of the Ist Book, and of whom he there speaks as the especial friend of Virgil.
Donatus and Servius make him Alfenus Varus, who waS, according to the latter
grammarian, appointed to sueceed Pollio in the government of the country in
which Mantua was situate. This opinion is rejected by Heyne‚ from chronologi-
cal considerations. Yet it is not necessary to suppose the Varus of the gram-
marians the same with the eminent jurist 3 and no person was so likely to have
been instrumental in reinstating the poet in his possessions, as he who had them
in absolute control.

That Virgil was early acquainted with Augustus, Maecenas, and many of the
most eminent literary persons of his time, and that this acquaintance was not
long in ripening into intimacy, is certain 3 though of the origin of this intercourse
we have no accounts but such as are palpably fabulous. The misibrtunes of his
youth were probably, as is sometimes the case, the foundation of his subsequent
elevation. These brought him into communication with men who would soon
appreciate his elegant and cultivated mind. At an early period of his acquain-
tance with Maecenas he accompanied that statesman, together with Horace,
Varius, and Plotius, on the celebrated expedition to Brundusium, whither the
minister was sent by Augustus to treat with Antony. From the same munificent
patron he acquired an ample fortune, and had residences in Rome, Campania,
and (according to Donatus) iu Sicily. The authority of this writer, which,
however, is not always to be implicitly relied on, pronounces the poet to have
been kind and generous to his parents, and the general character of virgil here
confir-ms the statement of his biographer.

Virgil was studious of the opportunities which his own good fortune had given
him of enriching his country's literature. His local situation, added to his mode
of living, had engendered in him a strong perception of the pleasures of rural
